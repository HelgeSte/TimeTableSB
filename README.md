This project is mostly done as a part of self-education in Java and Spring Boot. I used JDBC with MySQL in a previous project, but for this new one, I had to code create, read, update, delete and find methods for each class. The main reason for this project, is to use Spring Boot to do most of the work for me. It is based on a group project from a internet services course at the University of Agder.

In this project, MySQL was used for database. Code from Core Java Fundamentals Volume 2, 12th edition, was used for the DbUtilitites file. 
It doesn't have a gui or web-ui, and Junit testing was used for testing the functionality of the project.
My plan is to learn to use Spring and use it to setup a browser interface.
